# Computational geometry algorithms

This repository contains various computational geometry algorithms. For now, only Python code is used.

The two primary purposes of the reposoory are:

1. To explain how the algorithms work
2. To provide small code chucks that can be used in projects without bringing on heavy dependencies

Because of point 2, the algorithms must not have any external dependencies themselves. Thus, for Python, only the Standard Library can be used.

> Note that `numpy` is used in this repository only for testing the correctness of some of the algorithms, but not used in the algorihtms themselves.

## Available algororithms

* [Convex Hull](computational_geometry/convex_hull.py) (Graham Scan algorithm)
* [Move Point Towards Other Point](/computational_geometry/points.py)
* [Polygon Area](/computational_geometry/polygon.py)
